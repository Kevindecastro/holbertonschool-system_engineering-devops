## üîπ Infrastructure Components

### What is a server ?
A physical or virtual machine hosting services.

### What is the role of the domain name ?
Human-readable address (foobar.com) that maps to the server's IP via DNS.

### What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
A type A record, mapping www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.

### What is the role of the web server ?
A web server (e.g., Nginx) handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

### What is the role of the application server ?
An application server (e.g., Flask, Django) runs backend code, processes business logic, and communicates with the database.

### What is the role of the database ?
A database (e.g., MySQL) stores persistent application data, such as user information, content, and transactions.

### What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website ?
Communication occurs via HTTP or HTTPS protocols over the TCP/IP stack. HTTPS adds encryption through SSL/TLS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure Limitations

### SPOF (Single Point of Failure) :
If the server goes down, the entire website becomes unreachable.

### Downtime During Maintenance :
Updating code or restarting services causes site unavailability.

### No Scalability :
One server cannot handle a high volume of simultaneous requests.
